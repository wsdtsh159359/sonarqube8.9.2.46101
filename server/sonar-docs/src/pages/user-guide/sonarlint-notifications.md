Smart notifications allow developers using Connected Mode in SonarLint to receive in-IDE notifications from SonarQube when:

* the Quality Gate status (failed / success) of a project /solution _open in the IDE_ changes
* a {instance} analysis raises new issues _introduced by this developer in a project /solution open in the IDE_

## Activate/deactivate Notifications
The activation or deactivation of notifications must be done individually, by each developer directly in SonarLint (on the IDE side).

Receiving notifications is configurable on the SonarLint side on a SonarQube server-by-server basis.
